            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Oly, and beloved: This little Treatise, seeketh not the patronage of the worldly wise, mighty, or hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; it craves not the favour of vertuous Lady, or Christian Gentlewoman: It shrewds not it self, under the roof of any great Lord, or Patron, But it lieth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, at your feet; it submitteth it self, with all humility, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your censure; whatsoever is well done presumeth of your approbation; whatsoever is faulty, expects your meek and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle correction. Vnto your view I am bold to present it. My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, my mother, my brethren, and my sisters. To cast down the man of sin is now the profession of many, and every hand thinks it a happinesse, to lop off a bough, from this over-spreading tree. Now <hi>every purpose is established by counsell, and with good advice make warre. Prov. 20.18.</hi> In this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall warfare, I have endeavoured, to contribute my mite of consultation: He that striveth, to take away the spreading boughs of Antichrist may seeme to do a good work. But will not his labour be almost lost, they will sprout again, so long as the root remaineth in the earth; Therefore is it that your unworthy brother, and companion in tribulation, hath adventured to lay the mattock, unto the root of the tree, therefore have I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined Babels foundations, that the pillar being plucked away, whereon the whole house leaneth, the fabrick may fall upon their heads at once: that the roots being discovered, and cut insun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the next blast may throw the tree down to the ground, and then shall the armes thereof be shattered in the fall. These words
<pb facs="tcp:66203:3"/>were sometimes since preached unto an Auditory: And upon request of some of the hearers, I have condescended to give you a copy: wherein is something more, but to my knowledge nothing lesse then what was spoken: The Lord hath set me as a <hi>man of contention:</hi> This Sermon being at I am perswaded, the very inward cause, of all my troubles, and imprisonment; Although I confesse nothing herein, was laid to my charge: That was the subtilty of the Serpent, who knew well that he was not able to mannage, any thing against me that was here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered; and therefore waving this altogether, He hath sought occasion against me (and found it also) in the doctrine of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme. This was the thing, that first of all did inflame the hearts of my opposers, and cause them to swell with envy, and to break forth, into a rude opposition; which flame could not be quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but was more increased, untill, through their suggestions, and informations, I was cast into prison: That it might not fare better with me then with others. The <hi>Lord lay not this sin to their charge:</hi> now I do present this unto you, that your wisdome may take it into consideration, whether there were any Just cause of exception, in that which was delivered, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those floods of water, cast out of the mouth, I meane oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious, and reviling speeches, were not the fruits of him, that is, and will be alwayes opposite unto the truth. Brethren, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you to pray for me; that knowledge, and utterance, courage and patience, may be given unto me, that I may not cease to speak the things I have beleeved: that the Lord would give me that honour, that whether in bonds, or at liberty, whether by life or by death, I may glorifie his Name, in the edification of his Church, in the most holy faith. Brethren farewell. The God of peace fill you, with all joy, and peace, in beleeving. Amen.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T will be convenient, before we enter upon these words, to consider the occasion of them, in the coherence of the Text, with the foregoing words of the Chapter, because some question may arise about them. The <hi>Apostle</hi> doth beseech them, <hi>by the coming of the Lord Jesus, and by our gathering together unto him, that ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.</hi> What is this, the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> have heard that the day of <hi>Christ</hi> is at hand, and they are not a little perplexed; is the day of <hi>Christ</hi> become an unwelcome day? to the <hi>Church, in God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ?</hi> to the <hi>people</hi> unto whom is preached, <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ?</hi> Is not the day of <hi>Christ, a day of restitution of all things?</hi> Acts 3.21. Is not the day of <hi>Christ</hi> a day of <hi>redemption,</hi> a day of <hi>the glorious liberty of the sons of God,</hi> Rom. 8.21.23. how then can it be fearfull to them who are <hi>in God the Father?</hi> Doth not the Church groan within her self <hi>waiting for the Adoption,</hi> Rom. 8.23. Doth not the <hi>Bride</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> say, <hi>Come?</hi> and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66203:4"/>doth nothe that heareth say <hi>Come?</hi> and doth not the voice of the <hi>turtle</hi> answer, <hi>Even so, Come Lord Jesus?</hi> Rev. 22.17.20. O my soule, is any thing more welcome unto thee, then the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Son of righteousnesse? O let him come, and not tarry: why stay the wheeles of his chariots so long, and why is he so long in coming? If it be so, why is it thus, with his people? They are troubled, they are shaken in mind, because they hear that the day of <hi>Christ</hi> is at hand: is the day of Christ a trouble, and an heart-shake unto the Church of God? No: <hi>This</hi> is not <hi>it,</hi> But hence proceeds the trouble: the <hi>Apostle</hi> had told them otherwise, <hi>viz.</hi> that the day of <hi>Christ</hi> was not yet come. <hi>Remember ye not that when I was yet with you, I told you these things:</hi> vers. 5. Now that <hi>Paul</hi> should tell them one thing, and write another, that he should contradict himself, or that there should be a division, between his former, and latter speeches: This was the trouble of mind, this was the shaking of heart. For the curing whereof, the <hi>Apostle</hi> assureth them, that he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sent this message unto them, one way, or other, as the false Apostles would have made them beleeve. But that before the day of <hi>Christ,</hi> That man of sin must be revealed. Oh that the teachers of the people of God would consider within themselves, from that which hath been spoken: whence the great thoughts of heart do arise, even from the divisions, and distractions of the chaire. When you are contrary one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and many times, one man unto himself, How do you fill the tender souls of the people of God with heavy and insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable griefe.</p>
            <p>If then such be the fruit of these divisions, let me beseech you <hi>by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> and <hi>by our gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unto him,</hi> that you labour, to be of <hi>one mind in the Lord.</hi> To speak the same things in <hi>Jesus.</hi> I will say no more touching the coherence of the text. But come forthwith unto the words read unto you. <hi>And that man of sin be revealed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole scope of my Discourse, shall be to shew you why this same wicked one in my text is called, <hi>The man of sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>man of sin</hi> may seem to be an <hi>Hebraisme,</hi> signifying an exceeding sinfull man. And this is true, that <hi>Antichrist is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding sinfull one.</hi> But this is not all, for he seemeth to be called
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66203:4"/>the <hi>man of sin,</hi> in opposition to <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> who is called a <hi>God of righteousnesse,</hi> Jer. 23.6. Psal. 4.1. A <hi>Sun of righteousnesse,</hi> Mal. 4.2. And he is thus called not onely because <hi>Righteousnesse is the girdle of his loines:</hi> Isa. 11.5. but also because <hi>he hath filled Zion with righteousnesse and judgement,</hi> Isa. 33.5. It is the designe of <hi>Christ</hi> to pull down <hi>sin,</hi> and to bring in <hi>righteousnesse,</hi> to set up <hi>righteousnesse,</hi> according to that which is written, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. to <hi>finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousnesse.</hi> And therefore is he called the <hi>God of righteousnesse,</hi> the <hi>Sun of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,</hi> &amp;c. It is the designe of <hi>Antichrist</hi> to pull down righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, and to set up sin: to build again that which <hi>Christ</hi> hath pulled down, and to seek to pull down, that which Christ built up, and therefore he is justly called, <hi>The man of Sinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no better way, to discerne one contrary, than by another, when both are compared together.</p>
            <p>These two, <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Antichrist,</hi> the <hi>Sun of righteousnesse,</hi> and <hi>the man of sin,</hi> being so contrary the one unto the other, as light and darknesse: The one will help us in the discerning of the other. I will therefore first of all endeavour, to declare unto you the office of <hi>Christ,</hi> inasmuch as it is conversant about sin, and then I shall with great ease, discover unto you the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry designe, of <hi>Antichrist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the first. We must consider <hi>sin</hi> in a threefold relation, according as it is manifested in the <hi>Law,</hi> by which is the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Sin in the sight of God:</hi> the designe of <hi>Christ</hi> to take away sin out of the sight of God.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>Sin in the consciences of Gods people,</hi> the designe of <hi>Christ,</hi> to take away sin, out of the consciences of Gods people.</item>
               <item>3. <hi>Sin in the conversation,</hi> the designe of <hi>Christ</hi> to take away sin, out of the conversation of his chosen, and called people.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I will invert the order, which I have laid down: And en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to shew unto you the last in the first place, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is a designe of <hi>Christ,</hi> to purge the conversations of his chosen, and called people: The smoak of <hi>Hell</hi> hath sometimes said, If I be elected, I may live as I list. But what saith the Spirit of <hi>God:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66203:5"/>Elect unto obedience, and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.1. That <hi>God</hi> that hath elected thee, in Christ Jesus, before the world began, hath elected thee unto obedience, and not unto disobedience: Thou art not chosen, to be like the <hi>prince</hi> of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to walk in the vanity of thy mind: But to walk in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse as becometh Saints.</p>
            <p>The <hi>new creature</hi> hath this end for one: <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.10. <hi>For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus, unto good works, which God hath before ordained, that we should walk in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the question be asked, <hi>why Christ gave himself for us?</hi> will not the answer be this? <hi>That he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himself, a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi> Tit. 2.14. When a <hi>captive</hi> is in prison, the Redeemer payes a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, that the captive may be his freeman, to serve him in all offices of love. This was, and is our case, when we were cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated under sin, death, and hell; the <hi>Father</hi> sends his <hi>Son,</hi> to deliver us from all these, <hi>that we being delivered from our enemies, might serve him without fear in holinesse, and righteousnesse before him all the dayes of our life:</hi> Luk. 1.74, 75. If we search into the ends of Gods sending his <hi>Spirit</hi> into the hearts of the sons of men, we shall find the first to be, <hi>that we might know the things that are freely given unto us of God:</hi> 1 Cor. 2.12. and therefore is he called the <hi>Spirit of truth, leading into all truth,</hi> Joh. 16.13. Secondly, the second end of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is to make the soule to rejoyce in God abundantly, and therefore he is called the <hi>Comforter,</hi> Joh. 16.7. Thirdly, A third end of the <hi>Spirit</hi> sent into the heart of man, is to change, and alter the affections, and therefore is this <hi>Spirit</hi> called the <hi>Spirit of love,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.7. because <hi>the fruit of the spirit is love,</hi> Gal. 5.22. and <hi>love is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Law,</hi> Rom. 13.10.</p>
            <p>If we search into the ends of the <hi>ministery of the Word,</hi> we shall find them the very same, for the <hi>Word</hi> is nothing else by, an instrument in the hand of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> whereby the <hi>spirit</hi> is ordinarily administred unto the heart (I beleeve it will be no absurdity to say, the <hi>spirit</hi> administreth, the <hi>spirit</hi> by the <hi>Word.</hi>) Now the <hi>Word</hi> doth not onely hold out unto us the <hi>grace of G, in Jesus,</hi> but it doth thereby also teach us, that <hi>denying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>god inesse and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66203:5"/>godly in this present world,</hi> Tit. 2.12. The <hi>Word</hi> doth not onely hold out unto us, precious, and sure <hi>promises,</hi> but it doth also call upon us, with earnestnesse: <hi>Having these promises, let us cleanse our selves from all filthinesse both of flesh and spirit, perfecting holinesse in the fear of God:</hi> 2 Cor. 6.1. the Word, and Spirit, are both compared to <hi>fire,</hi> Jer. 5.14. Matth. 3.11. Now it is the propertie of <hi>fire,</hi> not onely to expell <hi>darknesse,</hi> by its <hi>light,</hi> but also to drive away <hi>cold</hi> by its <hi>heat:</hi> we do not read of any fire, that hath heat without light, except the metaphoricall fire of <hi>Hell:</hi> which burns in darknesse. Neither do we know any fires, that have light without heat, except the meteors of the ayre, which endure but the twinkling of an eye, and do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently vanish away. But why do I stay so long, upon a thing so plain? yet before I passe from it altogether, give me your patience, unto two, or three words of application.</p>
            <p>The first is; to free the <hi>glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ,</hi> and the revelation of the riches of grace, from that cloud which doth eclipse it, from the eyes, and affections of very many: Because it hath by reason of evill tongues, and credulous eares, incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an unjust suspicion of <hi>liberty,</hi> and <hi>licentiousnesse:</hi> But is this so? we call heaven and earth to record, that the Gospel teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>holinesse,</hi> and <hi>sobriety,</hi> and <hi>temperance,</hi> and whatsoever is of <hi>good report,</hi> yea it teacheth to avoid, even the occasions of evil: we call heaven and earth to record, whether the <hi>Gospel</hi> do not draw us unto an <hi>holy obedience,</hi> with as forcible (I will be bold to say, more forcible) and effectuall <hi>cords,</hi> than any doctrine whatsoever; for the Gospel draweth with the <hi>cords of love;</hi> which is as strong as death, nothing can be able to resist it, for <hi>many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it; if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.</hi> Cant. 8.7. I call again, heaven and earth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, whether any Doctrine can conferre such power, (if I speak improperly I will be contented to alter my speech) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> do work so powerfully in the soul, by any Doctrine as by the Doctrine of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> indeed shews us what is to be done, <hi>threatens</hi> us heavily if we do it not, <hi>rewards</hi> us plentifully, if we do it: but all this while it mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistreth unto us more quickning <hi>power;</hi> but leaves us <hi>dead,</hi> yea
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66203:6"/>the more we hear it, (if we heare it aright) the more <hi>dead</hi> we are. <hi>For when the Commandment came, sin revived, and I died, and the Commandment which was unto life, I found to be unto death.</hi> Rom. 7.9, 10. But the <hi>Gospel,</hi> the word of grace, is the ministration of a <hi>quickning spirit,</hi> not onely calling upon us to do, but also giving power to perform. Therefore is the <hi>word of grace</hi> called <hi>Healing words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which is according to godlinesse.</hi> 1 Tim. 6.3.</p>
            <p>But if these things be so, how come so many foule accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, so many heavie charges, to be cast upon this Doctrine?</p>
            <p>I answer, <hi>the servant is not greater then his Master, they shall speak all manner of evill of you falsly, for my Names sake.</hi> Matth. 5.11. I must say of these men, as the Apostle of the Jews: <hi>Had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory:</hi> 1 Cor. 2.8. But now <hi>they speak evill of those things they understand not.</hi> Jude 10. I desire to pray for them, in the words of our crucified Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they do.</hi> The Law of man exempteth all blind men from going to warre, lest they should do more hurt than good, and be rather burdensome than profitable: The Law of God admitteth of no blind priest to serve in the Sanctuary of God. Men use to scare their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with a blind priest (a very terrible thing) the <hi>builders</hi> are ignorant, and therefore have they rejected the <hi>chief corner stone.</hi> Therefore have they refused the <hi>fountains of living waters, and digged unto themselves cisterns which will hold no water.</hi> They speak evill of the Gospel, both preachers and people, (like Priest, like people) because they knew it not. <hi>Lord lay not this sin to their charge, Lord open thou their eyes that the blind may no longer lead the blind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus farre endeavoured to free the glorious <hi>Gospel</hi> from the foule and hell-born aspersion thus unjustly cast upon it; Let me in the next place have leave to turn my Discourse unto the watchmen of <hi>Israel,</hi> the servants of the <hi>Lord,</hi> whom he hath been pleased to call unto that office, and burden in the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> as to be dispensers of his Word; in <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>exhortation,</hi> in <hi>reproofe,</hi> and <hi>correction,</hi> I do beseech you in the name of the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> that you cease not, <hi>instantly to admonish every one with tears both night and day,</hi> Acts 20.31.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66203:6"/>that you reprove, and rebuke unruly walkers, with all autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. That you rebuke them sharply, that <hi>they may be sound in the faith,</hi> Tit. 1.13.</p>
            <p>A second word of application is, that I may earnestly call upon them, whom God hath brought unto the knowledge of his <hi>Son, that every one that nameth the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, depart from iniquity,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19. <hi>If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus, that ye put off concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former conversation, the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitfull lusts, &amp;c.</hi> Ephes. 4.22. for thus it <hi>becometh Saints,</hi> Ephes. 5.3. And <hi>this is the will of God even your sanctification, that ye abstain from fornication,</hi> 1 Thess. 4.3. Herein is <hi>God glorified: Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in heaven.</hi> Matth. 5.16.</p>
            <p>Herein is the <hi>Church comforted,</hi> the souls of your <hi>brethren</hi> chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: <hi>Joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastnesse of your faith in Christ,</hi> Col. 2.5. Hereby they that are <hi>without,</hi> upon whom the Word hath not had its full power, are sometimes called in. <hi>That if any obey not the Word, they also without the word may be won by the conversation of the wives.</hi> 1 Pet. 3.1. Now then if the <hi>win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of those that are without, if the <hi>comfort of</hi> your brethren within, if <hi>glorifying of God</hi> your Father, if the <hi>performance</hi> of his will, or if there could be any thing greater then these, that might be precious in your eyes; let me speak to you in the words of an Apostle: <hi>As obedient children, not fashioning your selves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy, in all manner of conversation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.14, 15.</p>
            <p>I have thus much to speak unto you on the right hand, now give me leave to turn to the left. If so be (which <hi>God</hi> forbid) that your conversation should be profane, contrary to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Commandment of our Saviour <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> Oh what will be the sequel. This is that which in Scripture phrase speaking after the manner of men, is called (to set forth the hideous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it) <hi>a grieving of the holy Spirit of God. And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.</hi> Ephes. 4.30. This is that which is called in Scripture <hi>a defiling of the members of Christ,</hi> and of the <hi>temple of God:</hi> then which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66203:7"/>what thing more hainous can be thought upon? <hi>Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.</hi> 1 Cor. 6.15. <hi>Know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy Ghost,</hi> verse 19.</p>
            <p>As your flesh cannot but tremble, to make the members of <hi>Christ</hi> the members of an <hi>Harlot:</hi> So let the <hi>zeal of Gods temple</hi> incite you, to make a scourge, of small smarting cords, to whip out of the Temple of our God, whatsoever is contrary to the doctrine of godlinesse. This is that, (even the carelesse conversation of the professors of godlinesse) which opens a gate unto hideous blasphemy, whereby <hi>the Name of God and his Doctrine is evill spoken of,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.1. And so you shall do your utmost endeavours hereby (which I hope you will fear to do) to <hi>keep back</hi> those that are coming in; to <hi>drive</hi> the wandring sheep farther from the fold of <hi>Christ Jesus.</hi> This is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Satan</hi> getteth advantage against you, whereby you lay your selves open to the <hi>snare of the devill, to great temptation and noysome lusts,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.26. Let me therefore end this with the <hi>Apostles</hi> words, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.11. <hi>That I may charge every one of you that ye would walk worthy of the Lord, who hath called you unto his kingdome,</hi> and glorie. Be not carelesse, but watchfull: Let <hi>piety</hi> prevail with you to watch diligently over your selves; let <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> prevaile with you to watch as diligently over your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
            <p>A third word of Application, unto such as <hi>hold the truth of God in unrighteousnesse,</hi> unto such (and hereof in the world there are not a few) God grant the Church may be free from them, <hi>who professe they know God, but by their works they deny him:</hi> Tit. 1.16. who increase in profanesse in <hi>conversation,</hi> as they grow and increase in the measure of <hi>revelation: Oh that mine eyes were a fountain of teares,</hi> that I might lament over them; oh that the teares of a deare friend, who (the Lord is my witnes) writes not these things with dry eyes, might so farre prevail with you, that you would take his words into the deepest of your confiderations; that you would repent of the evil of your wayes, submit unto the yoke of Christ; that your conversation may answer your profession.</p>
            <p>Have you not seen an <hi>heifer</hi> unaccustomed to the yoke, stand
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66203:7"/>as gently at the crib, as any other; but bring the yoke, and the very fight of it shall make her kick with the foot, and push with the horn, and seek all means to shun it: I would you would be contented to make the application your selves; you stand gently at <hi>Christs</hi> crib; you are contented to heare, the sweet promises of the Gospel containing and holding forth what Christ hath done for you, these things I say you heare with great patience, approbation, and delight. But when it comes to this, that you are admonished what you ought to do for <hi>Christ</hi> in obedience, in thankfulnesse, unto him that hath done all things for you. When the Church of Christ would put the yoke of Christ upon your neck, and compell you to come in unto her wholsome Discipline by her sweet perswasions; you spurn with the foot, you push with the horne, seeking meanes of evasion: <hi>Let us break their bonds, and cast away their cords from us,</hi> Psal. 2. either you will acknowledge no Church; or if a Church, yet one according to your own heart you cannot find. I have nothing to do to judge you (I confesse it) I leave you unto him that judgeth all things, the Lord open your hearts.</p>
            <p>And I shall betake my self unto the second consideration; <hi>of sin in the Consciences of the called people of God.</hi> The thing that I have to declare is thin that it is <hi>the designe of the Lord Christ, to take away sin, out of the consciences of his called people:</hi> whereby the called of God may have the <hi>answer of a good conscience towards God:</hi> 1 Pet. 3.21. that the consciences of Gods called, are clear, and white, and pure, and undefiled from sin, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, through the apprehension of the efficacy of the death, and resurrection of the <hi>Lord Jesus Christ:</hi> whereby they are <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten unto a lively hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead;</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3. whereby they may have boldnesse before the throne of grace, even the throne of that <hi>God</hi> who hath <hi>eyes</hi> that <hi>will behold no iniquity:</hi> Before that throne of that God, <hi>who is a consuming fire,</hi> Hebr. 12.29.</p>
            <p>This is the effect of the faith of Gods elect, to purifie the heart. <hi>The Lord put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith,</hi> Acts 15.9. What can here be meant by the word <hi>heart,</hi> lesse then conscience? now if the conscience be <hi>pure,</hi> it is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66203:8"/>without <hi>spot:</hi> if it be not without <hi>spot,</hi> then is it not <hi>pure.</hi> That by heart is meant nothing lesse than conscience, is proved by other places of Scripture, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.30. <hi>A sound heart is the life of the flesh.</hi> And <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.13. <hi>A good heart maketh a cheerfull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</hi> But lest some should say, that by the word <hi>heart,</hi> is meant lesse than <hi>conscience,</hi> I shall desire to speak plain. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.9. the <hi>Apostle</hi> shewing the weaknesse of legall sacrifices, and services, saith, that <hi>they could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience.</hi> But the priesthood of <hi>Christ Jesus, the Mediator of a better Testament, established upon better promises,</hi> hath done that which the Law could not do: <hi>How much more shall the blood of Christ who without spot offered himself to God, purge your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences from dead works, to serve the living God.</hi> Heb. 9.14. <hi>The Law could not make perfect, as pertaining to the conscience,</hi> but what the Law could not do in that it was weak; through the infirmities of flesh, that <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> hath done by his sacrifice, of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
            <p>We reason thus: if <hi>Christ</hi> did not purge the conscience, then is it yet impure; then is not his purgation as pertaining to the conscience, of more efficacy than legall purgations were: they purged not the <hi>Conscience,</hi> no more did he: But it is plain that he did purge the conscience. Now if he did purge, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the conscience, then is the conscience pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled; if it be not pure and undefiled, then did not he purge it. But that <hi>Christ</hi> did purge the conscience is plain, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.2. <hi>Because the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.</hi> It is the drift of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> in this place, to shew the reason why the Law sacrifices did cease to be offered, because <hi>they could not make the commers thereunto perfect:</hi> That they were not made perfect, is proved, because <hi>they had conscience of sin.</hi> But now the <hi>offering of Christ, hath perfected for ever, them that are sanctified,</hi> Heb. 10.14. If they be perfected, then are they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; if purged, the comers thereunto must have no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of sin: But <hi>they draw nigh unto God, with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having their hearts sprinkled from an evill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and their bodies washed with pure water.</hi> Heb. 10.22.</p>
            <p>By this we may understand what is meant by those meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricall speeches, which we read of, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.4. and 4.4. and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66203:8"/>6.11. with many other places; where the Saints are set out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, in <hi>white rayment,</hi> from the crown of the head, to the soale of the foot. This white rayment signifying, not onely that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and cleannesse which they have before God: but also that purity and cleannesse of <hi>conscience,</hi> confisting in the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of that glorious estate and condition, whereinto they were stated by the death and passion of the <hi>Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think it is sufficiently proved, that the consciences of the called people of God, are purged, and purified from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of sin, and uncleannesse: and it would be lawfull for me to proceed, did there not an objection lie in way; which may be an occasion of stumbling, unto those that are weak: and have not their sences exercised in such manner of questions as these are.</p>
            <p>The objection is this: <hi>If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ovr selves, and the truth is not in us:</hi> 1 Joh. 1.8. <hi>If we say we have not sinned, we make him a lyar,</hi> verse 10. <hi>In many things we offend all,</hi> Jam. 3.2. with many like places. Now saith the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, if we have sin, how can we be clean? if we be cleansed, how is it that we have sin?</p>
            <p>This objection is easily answered, by the words immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly going before, <hi>viz. The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin:</hi> 1 Joh. 1.7. and then presently follows; <hi>If we say we have no sin, &amp;c.</hi> vers. 8. Now here will lie the difficulty; if we be cleansed from <hi>all</hi> how have we <hi>any?</hi> if we have yet <hi>any,</hi> how are we cleansed from <hi>all?</hi> For the clearing of an answer; I must intreat you to consider of sin, in a twofold respect, as hath been spoken at large before, <hi>viz. sin,</hi> in the <hi>conversation,</hi> and sin in the <hi>conscience.</hi> The called of God are not quite purged from sin in <hi>conversation,</hi> for <hi>all our righteousnesses are as an unclean thing:</hi> Isa. 64.6. The called of God are quite cleansed from sin in <hi>conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall speak a riddle to some, to whom it is not given to know the mysteries of the kingdome, but you to whom it is given, will understand what I shall say. The thing is this, that as it is possible, for a man that hath been beyond comparison strict, and upright in his <hi>conversation,</hi> to have a foule and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted <hi>conscience,</hi> a heart clouded with <hi>ignorance,</hi> and <hi>estranged
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66203:9"/>from the life of God.</hi> So is it possible, for a man that hath been an exceeding sinner, and is not yet wholly cleansed from all wickednesse in conversation (which no man is) to have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, as white as the snow, and as pure as the wooll: if this seem a mystery unto you, that fin in the flesh, should stand with purity of conscience, take these Reasons to make it plain: If purity of conscience could be found no where but where there is purity in the flesh; a pure Conscience could not at all be found upon the earth, in regard that <hi>there is none that doth good, no not one:</hi> Rom. 3.12. Again, purity of <hi>conscience</hi> doth not take his rise, from purity of <hi>conversation.</hi> But purity of <hi>conversation,</hi> ariseth from purity of <hi>conscience.</hi> The originall of purity of conscience ariseth hence, from the apprehension of all our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities, and uncleannesse, <hi>to be laid upon Christ:</hi> Isa. 53.6. <hi>to be taken away by Christ,</hi> Joh. 1.29. Herein doth the conscience of a beleever rest <hi>in Jesus Christ crucified, and made sin for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This that hath been spoken, may serve to open unto us a doore of understanding, whereby those places which seem so contrary may be made plain. <hi>If we say we have no sin, &amp;c.</hi> and yet is it said: <hi>He that is born of God doth not commit sin, for his seed remaineth in him: And he cannot sin because he is born of God.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.9. What have we here? is not the <hi>Apostle</hi> born of God? are not they to whom he writeth, <hi>born of God?</hi> Yes, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction: yet doth he confesse, that he and they have sin: and again he saith, <hi>He that is born of God cannot sin.</hi> It is not unknown unto many that shall read this, how many windings, and turnings, how many unsound, and unsavourie distinctions, have been invented by the wit of man; to reconcile these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: which are easily reconciled by that which hath been spoken: The called of God (even the most upright of them) have fin in the <hi>flesh,</hi> they have fin in the <hi>conversation.</hi> But they have no sin, neither can they have any fin in the <hi>conscience:</hi> for the <hi>true faith of Gods elect,</hi> and fin in the <hi>conscience,</hi> can no more stand together, then light and darknesse.</p>
            <p>Let this that hath been spoken, become a touchstone to try our faith by: Doth thy faith purifie the heart through the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of the blood of Jesus? doth it cleanse thy consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from all sin? so that not one remaineth behind? Then
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66203:9"/>hath it this property of a true faith. But when the soul shall thus conceive within it self, that this sin, or that sin lieth yet upon me, if it were not for such, or such a fin, (greater it may be than ordinary) I should judge my self in a happy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Give me leave, with patience, to declare thine errour. Surely Chirst cleanseth not imperfectly, he doth not wash away some stains, and leave others: if he cleanse thee not from this sin, he hath cleansed thee from no sin. If he hath not clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thee from any one sin, surely he hath washed thee from none at all; or he hath perfected, as was spoken before. But thou hast one sin yet unpardoned, unwashed away. I demand of thee; who shall wash it away? and when shall it be washed away? seeing <hi>Christ dieth no more, he sheddeth his blood no more, he offereth no more:</hi> I confesse a man that knows not Jesus may presume of the pardon of all his sins, and see his conscience purged by a false <hi>Christ.</hi> But I will be bold to affirm, that he that seeth not all his sins taken away, never knew the true Christ.</p>
            <p>Thus have we seen the designe of the Lord Christ, to purge the consciences of his called people, that they shall have no more conscience of sin. Now if this be so; do you desire that I should shew you a place where joy and gladnesse dwell? where sorrow, and sighing (in respect of unpardoned sin) have no more place? But everlasting comforts rest upon their heads. Behold, it is the conscience of Gods called ones, that are brought unto the apprehension of the <hi>light of the glory of God in the face of Jesus:</hi> whose <hi>joy</hi> cannot be taken away, whose <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts</hi> cannot be spoiled. Now blessed, thrice blessed are the people, that are in such a case. <hi>Blessed are the people who have their rest in the God: who hath shewed them the path of life: in whose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence is fulnesse of joy, at whose right hand there are pleasures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more:</hi> Psal. 16.11.</p>
            <p>It is now time that I should come to shew you the <hi>taking away of sin</hi> considered in the third respect, as it is taken away out of the <hi>sight of God:</hi> the designe of Christ by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Father, to take away sin, out of the sight of God. Christ is set forth unto us as a <hi>propitiation,</hi> and a <hi>Lambe of atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> an <hi>offering for sin,</hi> Isa. 53.10. <hi>When thou shalt make his soule
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66203:10"/>an offering for sin,</hi> the first consideration will be: to set forth, that <hi>Christ offered an offering to God.</hi> The second will be; to declare the <hi>end, and effect of his offering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, that <hi>Christ offered a sin-offering to God.</hi> Christ was made by God our high Priest. <hi>Now every Priest is ordained for men in things pertaining unto God to offer up sacrifices for sins:</hi> Hebr. 5.1. <hi>This he did once, when he offered up himself,</hi> Hebr. 7.27. that is, he once offered for the sins of the people: which is confirmed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.14. <hi>Who through the eternall Spirit offered himself without spot to God.</hi> By this it appears, that <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> was an offering unto God: But what was the effect of this offering? even to make <hi>atonement,</hi> to make <hi>peace,</hi> to <hi>redeeme us from the curse of the Law,</hi> from the tribulation, and anguish, indignation and wrath, which the Law had threatned, and must have (of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity) fallen upon us, had not he been <hi>made a curse for us.</hi> But in him the Father hath declared himself <hi>well pleased,</hi> Isay, well pleased in him, that so through him the Father might mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest unto us, his eternall pleasure; and we again, might through him have <hi>boldnesse of accesse before the throne of his grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here comes a difficult question to be discussed: whether wrath and indignation did now lie upon the creature for sin, in respect of God: I answer, No. And my reason is; because we had an high Priest over the house of God, which was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning, and end of dayes, between whom, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all things are <hi>acted and transacted</hi> before the world began: and therefore we read <hi>of eternall life promised before the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan:</hi> Tit. 1.2. But if this be so, how is <hi>Christ</hi> said <hi>to deliver us from wrath?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> I will shew you in the words of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> 1 Thes. 1.10. <hi>Jesus which delivered us from wrath to come:</hi> from wrath which must have fallen upon us, if <hi>Jesus</hi> had not been a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator. Give me a time wherein his priesthood, and sacrifice, was not present, and effectuall with the Father; and I will grant, that all that time, the creature lieth under wrath. But that you may see that these things were transacted with the <hi>Father</hi> (according to his good pleasure) before the <hi>messenger of the Covenant</hi> had offered himself upon the Crosse, you have the witnesse of the Father from heaven, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66203:10"/>whom I am well pleased.</hi> The <hi>Son</hi> had not yet actually suffered, his <hi>blood</hi> was not yet shed upon the crosse, and yet the Father saith, I am well pleased, I am contented.</p>
            <p>The Father is well pleased, but it is in the Son, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his sufferings; to shew that he was <hi>a Lambe slain from the foundation of the world.</hi> But if the Father were well pleased be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his suffering, what need was there that his blood should be shed? Will that God which doth nothing in vain, cause the blood of his Son to be shed in vain? surely no. What is it then? did the suffering of Christ onely respect the <hi>satisfaction</hi> of the consciences of beleevers? I answer. That the <hi>satisfaction</hi> of their consciences was herein respected, I dare not deny: but that the shedding of the blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> did onely respect their consciences I dare not affirme. But I must say, that the Justice of God revealed in the Law, did require that his blood should be shed; and that the Father manifests himself well pleased in his Son before his passion, doth presuppose (I want words to expresse what I would) his passion; (that in respect of man was yet to come) to be present with the Father. <hi>Great is the mystery of godlinesse, and who is sufficient for these things?</hi> I have thus farre declared unto you the office of Christ, in the pulling down of sin. The next thing that I have to declare, is the designe of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> in setting up sin, and pulling down righteousnesse; in seeking to build that which Christ hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, in destroying that which <hi>Christ</hi> hath built.</p>
            <p>There is a great question who is <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and divers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, many things diversly; every one according to his thoughts: some think the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is Antichrist, some the <hi>Bishops,</hi> some the <hi>Turke,</hi> &amp;c. But give me leave to tell you what I conceive, that to tye the name of <hi>Antichrist</hi> to a particular man, or to any particular succession of men, is to confine him unto too narrow a bound: I will not deny but that the <hi>Pope</hi> is a principall member of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> of the man of <hi>sin,</hi> the <hi>head</hi> if you please. But I do beleeve the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Antichrist</hi> to differ, as the part, and the whole, as the head, and the body: And I conceive the great <hi>Antichrist,</hi> to be that mysticall body of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, which opposeth <hi>Jesus Christ, Antichrist</hi> is as much as to say, against Christ: whosoever doth seek to destroy that which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66203:11"/>the <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> hath built up, or to build up that which the Lord hath pluck'd down, the same is against Christ, and i<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> so much a member of the great <hi>Antichrist.</hi> That these things may be more plain, I shall consider the <hi>Man of sin</hi> in that threefold consideration before spoken of, namely, 1. <hi>Sin in the conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 2. <hi>Sin in the conscience.</hi> 3. <hi>Sin in the sight of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, sin in the <hi>conversation.</hi> It cannot be denied, but that he that will endeavour to set up sin in the <hi>conversation</hi> of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is indeed against <hi>Christ,</hi> and so a man of sin; a limbe of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist:</hi> but yet our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath declared unto us, that the <hi>great man of sin,</hi> the great <hi>Antichrist,</hi> shall not be so palpable, as to set up sin, in the conversation; but that he shall come unto us in greater <hi>holinesse, zeale,</hi> and <hi>strictnesse,</hi> with eyes, and hands lifted up to heaven, as though his conversation were indeed there. Thus is fulfilled that which was forespoken by our <hi>Lord; Beware of false prophets, which come unto you in sheeps cloathing, but inwardly they are ravening woolves,</hi> Matth. 7.15. Like those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of old: who did <hi>weare a rough garment to deceive,</hi> Zach. 13.4. <hi>For there shall arise false Christs, and false Prophets, and shall shew great signes and wonders: insomuch that if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.</hi> Matt. 24.24. <hi>Satan is transformed into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>False Apostles, deceitfull workers, transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ, transformed as the Ministers of righteousnesse,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.14. They are <hi>zealous, they make a faire shew in the flesh:</hi> Gal. 6.12. The coming of the <hi>man</hi> of sin is, <hi>after the working of Satan, with all power, and signes, and lying wonders: with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveablenesse of unrighteousnesse:</hi> 2 Thes. 2.9, 10. <hi>He doth great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, so that he maketh fire to come down from heaven, in the sight of men:</hi> Rev. 13.13. even bringing many excellent truths of God, kindled at the flames of his altar.</p>
            <p>One thing more observable is, that such shall be his carriage, that he shall not onely deceive others, but himselfe also: so that in his own esteeme he shall be none other, but the servant of the true God, and his Son Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>We are deceived within our selves, if we look for <hi>Antichrist,</hi> to come like the heathen <hi>Bacchus,</hi> staggering up and down in the streets, wallowing in his vomit; we are deceived, if we look
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66203:11"/>for <hi>Antichrist,</hi> among the lewd sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> roarding in the Taverns. No, we shall find him in the <hi>Temple;</hi> sooner find him in the <hi>Pulpit:</hi> you shall find him at devotion, with great zeale, insomuch that whosoever hath not the spirit of discerning shall presume, that he is one of an excellent spirit: Little would any man suspect so much fraud, to lie in so holy a breast: (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to appearance) like unto him that seeing a <hi>Cat</hi> sit, (as their custome is) said, who could beleeve that so much cruelty should lurk under so meek a countenance? So when we look upon this <hi>man of sin,</hi> who could have imagined, that so much deceit, should lurk under so supercilious a brow?</p>
            <p>Alas, how open do those men lie unto deceit? who have no other touchstone for doctrine; but the zeale and holinesse of the conversation. This must needs be true, say some, for I heard a very <hi>holy</hi> man deliver it. Alas poore soule: doest not thou know that beast-like doctrine, drops often from men of holy conversation? Dost not thou see that the man of sin, is as tall in the holinesse of conversation, as the true Saints of God? as the Apostles of Christ? His garment as rough, his countenance as stedfast, his supplications as frequent, his zeale as great. O then beware of false Prophets, search the Scriptures, try all things.</p>
            <p>But you will say, if it be so, how shall I know the <hi>man of sin,</hi> if I meet him? is it not said, <hi>by their fruits ye shall know them?</hi> Mat. 7.16. if such be the fruits of the <hi>man of sin,</hi> how shall I be able to discern him? To this I answer. That there are two sorts of fruits; the fruits of <hi>Conversation,</hi> and the fruits of <hi>Doctrine:</hi> the fruits of the <hi>lips,</hi> and the fruits of the <hi>hands. I create the fruit of the lips,</hi> Isa. 57.19.</p>
            <p>Now the surest way to discover <hi>Antichrist,</hi> is by the fruit of his lips, by the discipline of his mouth: if we look upon the <hi>Apostles</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>man of sin,</hi> we shall find both of them holy in conversation; yea so holy that who can discern them, the one from the other. Therefore must we expect the voice, and ponder the Doctrine: it is the counsell of an <hi>Apostle</hi> in the same case. <hi>If any man come, and bring not this Doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed,</hi> 2 Joh. 10. <hi>If we or an Angel from heaven preach any other Gospel unto you,</hi> Gal. 1.8. When a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66203:12"/>
               <hi>woolfe</hi> cometh in sheeps cloathing, how shall we discern in the flock, which is the woolfe, when both are fleeced alike? must we not wait untill they utter their voices, and then we shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that the one <hi>bleateth,</hi> the other <hi>barketh.</hi> We read of a beast, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.11. (the Lord deliver us from him) <hi>that hath hornes like a lambe, and he spake as a Dragon.</hi> Though we cannot discern him by his horns, yet we may easily know him by his Dragon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like voice.</p>
            <p>A man of <hi>Cuma</hi> did put a Lyons skin very artificially upon the back of an Asse: The inhabitants of the place were much terrified, supposing that a Lyon indeed had been come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them; untill the Asse (at his accustomed time) began to bray like an Asse; so soon as they heard, not the roaring of the Lyon, but the braying of an Asse, their fears was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into laughter.</p>
            <p>What was the course that <hi>Jephthan</hi> took to discern the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phramites,</hi> from the <hi>Gileadites,</hi> at the foords of <hi>Jordan,</hi> Judg. 12.6. their faces were alike, their harnesse alike, their colours alike, their garments alike; and yet he discerneth them by their tongues. <hi>Say now Shibboleth, and he said sibboleth, for he could not frame to pronounce it.</hi> This will be the triall of the <hi>Man of sin,</hi> of the members of Antichrist, when they that have their sences exercised, shall discerne them to cry sibboleth in the Doctrine of godlinesse.</p>
            <p>Sure it is that this is the onely certain way of discerning: There is indeed another way, which is very probable, but not so certain in a double respect. It is by his <hi>scarlet</hi> coat, or gown: the <hi>woman that sitteth on the beast, is arayed in purple, and scarlet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,</hi> Revel. 17.4. the beast himself, was <hi>scarlet coloured,</hi> vers. 3. <hi>the great Dragon</hi> is for colour <hi>red,</hi> Rev. 12.3. and <hi>that great City was clothed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet,</hi> Revel. 18.16. Give me leave to ask this <hi>Man of Sin</hi> a question.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Who is this that cometh from Sion? with died garments from Jerusalem?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I, even I, the man of sin, the son of perdition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Wherefore art thou red in thine apparell, and thy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments like him that treadeth in the winefat?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> My feet are of Iron, and my nayls of Brasse, I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66203:12"/>and broken in peeces, and stamped the residue with my feet: I have made warre with the Saints, and prevailed against them, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.19.21.</p>
            <p>I have sprinkled my garments, with the blood of the Saints of the most high.</p>
            <p>A certain note of a false Church is persecution. King <hi>James</hi> upon <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. if the true Church do persecute, if <hi>Sarah</hi> will cast out <hi>Hagar,</hi> she doth what she ought not to do, and the thing is grievous in <hi>Abrahams</hi> sight. Seest thou then a generation of men, that are resolved to convert all men (<hi>Mahomet</hi> like) with guns, and pistols, with swords, and staves, with fire, and fagot, with bonds, and imprisonments, (I speak not against defence of the rights, and liberties) surely this is either the false Church of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and <hi>man of sin,</hi> the <hi>red dragon;</hi> or else it is the true Church, forgetting the command of her Lord, and Saviour. <hi>Let them alone,</hi> Matth. 15.14. If the true Church do so much forget her self, as thus to do, she must be contented to hear a word of reproofe, and to be remembred that the <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord must not strive: but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, in meeknesse instructing those that oppose themselves:</hi> 2 Tim. 2.24, 25.</p>
            <p>But here some will plead for the <hi>man of sin,</hi> that he doth well to persecute, or at least that the true Church doth well to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute men that are contrary minded. For did not <hi>Asa</hi> make a covenant, that <hi>whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman:</hi> 2 Chron. 15.13.</p>
            <p>I answer: That <hi>Elias</hi> prayed, and fire came down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and devoured the Captains with their fifties, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 1.10. Yet when the <hi>disciples</hi> would have had our Saviour to have destroyed the <hi>Samaritanes,</hi> in the like manner, because they would not receive him, they were sharply rebuked of him: <hi>Ye know not of what spirit ye are,</hi> Luke 9.55. The case between <hi>Asa</hi> and us, was very different: for first <hi>Asa</hi> had the command of God for what he did, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. but we have the command of God different. Let both grow together untill the harvest, <hi>Matt.</hi> 13.30. Again, a second difference is, that the whole people were members of a national Church by Gods appointment,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:66203:13"/>and so were subject to such censures as the Lord had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be executed upon disobedient members, that they should be cut off: which things were a type of that spirituall death, wherewith the great King of Judah shall avenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self at his glorious appearing, of all those that would not have him reigne over them. Now we do not deny, the Church of God the liberty to proceed against refractory members, by her heavy censurers, of delivering over unto <hi>Satan.</hi> But the question will be, whether or no <hi>Asa</hi> might lawfully have imposed this covenant upon the Edomites, or Arabians, (if they had been under his power) and have caused them to turn proselytes whether they would or not.</p>
            <p>That the Magistrate may punish offendors, against peace and liberty we grant; but that he should compell the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be of this or that judgement in Religion we cannot see: that the professors of the Gospel should seek to convert men to the knowledge of the Word, and profession of the same, by tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and cruelties, is strange to us; we professe we have not so learned Christ. Let the Kings of the earth recover their rights and priviledges, by force, and might; let them revenge every disobedience according unto merit, and desert. But let the Gospel be propagated by the two edged sword of Gods Spirit.</p>
            <p>But I must proceed no farther in this, but come unto the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Consideration of <hi>sin in the conscience,</hi> unto which I will also joyne the third: namely, the consideration of <hi>sin in the sight of God.</hi> And herein I shall shew you, that is the designe of <hi>Antichrist, to set up sin in the conscience, and in the sight of God.</hi> To perswade the world, that sin is not yet taken away out of the light of God, that so he may keep those under bondage, who are yet intangled, that so (if it were possible) he might bring them back again into bondage, who ae already escaped; that old Serpent envying nothing more than the peace, and joy of the Saints of God.</p>
            <p>This was an old plot of the <hi>man of sin,</hi> working by a myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of iniquity in the false <hi>Apostles</hi> of old, who taught the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple beleeving in God; that <hi>except ye be circumcised after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Moses, ye cannot be saved:</hi> Act. 15.1. As though hitherto,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66203:13"/>having looked at salvation accomplished in <hi>Jesus,</hi> and remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sins in his blood, they had been altogether deceived, and had beleeved a lye, for (according to their doctrine) there is more required than thus: for <hi>except ye be circumcised af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that the ayme of this project was to bring the people into bondage again, appeareth by that exhortation of the <hi>Apostle: Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not again intangled with the yoke of bondage:</hi> Gal. 5.1. And that the working of the mystery of iniquitie was forming this upon the <hi>Anvile,</hi> appeareth also in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.20. <hi>Yet suffer if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devoure you, &amp;c.</hi> In which words the <hi>Apostle</hi> doth set out unto us the whole, and onely ayme of those counterfeit apostles, to bring the people into bondage again.</p>
            <p>That it was the end and scope, of that working mystery of iniquity, to declare sin unpardoned; appeareth plain by their horrid policy striking at the very root, and foundation of all: <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>deny Christ coming in the flesh,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.22. or if come in the flesh, to deny him to be <hi>risen again,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. Now if <hi>Christ</hi> be not come in the flesh, what will follow? but that the world li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth yet in their sins. Nay although Christ be come in the flesh, and if he be not risen from the dead, <hi>your faith is vain, and ye are yet in your sins:</hi> 1 Cor. 15.17. Now that this is the fort and great work, that the <hi>man of sin</hi> so much desires to win from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, that they are yet in their sins, appeareth plaine from that first working of the mystery of iniquitie: even in the <hi>Apostles</hi> dayes. Thus you see <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Antichrist,</hi> the <hi>Son of righteousnesse,</hi> and the <hi>man of sin</hi> opposed each to other; what the one buildeth, the other pulleth down; what the one pulleth down, the other buildeth: If it be granted unto me, that he that setteth up sin in the <hi>sight of God,</hi> or <hi>consciences of Gods called</hi> people: After <hi>Christ</hi> hath taken it away, may very justly be called a <hi>man of sin:</hi> an <hi>opposer of Christ Jesus:</hi> I shall then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, to charge the <hi>Man of Sin</hi> more plainly, that his face may be discovered, and his visage known unto those that shall cast their eyes upon him. I shall here presume to challenge <hi>Rome,</hi> and those that do any way conspire with her, in many of their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66203:14"/>foundations, to be opposite unto Christ in the setting up of sin, which he hath taken away.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Baptisme taketh away sin, purgeth the soul, not onely in conscience, but also in the fight of God, is a Doctrine common with <hi>Romes</hi> favourites, and boldly held forth by some, without any blushing in the whoores forehead. Now what is this but the man of sin, to deny that the Lamb of God hath taken away the sin of the world? Either Christ hath fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, taken away sin; or he hath not finished it, by his one and alone offering: if he have not; then hath the Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived us (which God forbid should enter into the heart of man:) if he hath taken it away, what truth will be found in this doctrine? I may not forget, to premise a distinction where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the <hi>whore</hi> seeketh to cover her fraud, and the <hi>man of sin</hi> to shrowd his deceit. The distinction is found in <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and others, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>price,</hi> and <hi>application.</hi> In respect of a <hi>price</hi> payd, they confesse that satisfaction is made for all sins, past, present, and to come; but in respect of <hi>application</hi> of the price, it is made by Baptisme, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To shew the fraud of this distinction, I shall ask one questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Whether any perfection be to the creature, without the application of this price?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Surely no, but <hi>by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified,</hi> Hebr. 10. And we have the revelation of God, that the price is not onely payd, but that also the <hi>Father is well pleased,</hi> Matth. 3. the <hi>ne Covenant is ratified</hi> from the time of the death of the Testator.</p>
            <p>That such things as these shouldcome from <hi>Rome,</hi> that the hot <hi>climate</hi> of <hi>Africa</hi> should breed snakes and serpents is no wonder: But who could have thought to have found such in <hi>England?</hi> professing themselves at variance with the <hi>whore?</hi> That should stand up in defence of this Proposition? That Baptisme washeth away sin? and yet this is too true. As divers can testifie whose eares have been witnesses; And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (lest their words should seem to want weight) they flie unto that place, wherein <hi>Ananias</hi> speaks to <hi>Paul</hi> in these words, <hi>Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the Name of the Lord:</hi> Act. 22.16. A plain text. For answer to this: I shall
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66203:14"/>produce no other thing, than what I then demanded, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those words were spoken to a <hi>beleever,</hi> or an <hi>unbeleever?</hi> The Answer is, to a beleever; otherwise, he ought not to have been exhorted to submission unto <hi>Baptisme.</hi> If these words were spoken to a <hi>beleever,</hi> I beseech you to consider seriously, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of this Argument: which would make us conceive, that sins are not yet pardoned to a beleever; but that a beleever may have his sins unpardoned: which I leave to your censure. But some will say, what meaneth then this terme: <hi>wash away thy sins.</hi> I answer: This is none other then, <hi>Break off thy sins,</hi> a washing in <hi>conversation,</hi> that it may appeare before the face of the world, that thou art another manner of man than hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thou hast appeared for to be. <hi>They that are already washed in respect of Gods imputation, they that are already washed in conscience in respect of manifestation, and apprehension of the grace of God in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, may yet, and ought to be exhorted to wash in respect of conversation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you see the subtiltie of the Serpent how closely he lurketh, how cunningly he behaveth himself, to oppose the truth of God, to set up sin again, and to bring the conscience under bondage.</p>
            <p>Now I have begun, I will be bold to challenge the <hi>man of sin,</hi> in other of his Doctrines, destructive unto the manifestation of the grace of God, in remission of sins: <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>doctrine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> that <hi>repentance washeth away sin,</hi> and that there is no forgivenesse with God before repentance: is so commonly, and ordinarily known unto you, that it need not be confirmed by testimonies against him. If he should deny that he hath taught the peopleany such thing, his own mouth will be witnesse against him, his own writings will condemne him; and indeed the thing is more lain than can be denied: And he is so farre from denying of it, that he will rather stand to defend it. And what more contrary unto the grace of God?</p>
            <p>Now that the <hi>originall</hi> of this error may be discovered, that the weaknesse of this grand worke may be discoferned; and a <hi>doore</hi> to answer his objections opened: I shall desire you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fider the difference, of the manifestation, of remission of sins in Scripture, according to the difference, of the <hi>Covenant</hi> mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested in the same: In the <hi>first covenant,</hi> the <hi>worldly sanctuary,</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:66203:15"/>Hebr. 9.1. the <hi>carnall commandment,</hi> Hebr. 7.16. I say in that covenant: as there was no remission for some sins; so, <hi>contrition, confession,</hi> and <hi>satisfaction</hi> (such as that law required) of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner must needs go before remission of any sin: But in the grace of the <hi>new covenant</hi> in the blood of <hi>Jesus: Remission of sins,</hi> (yea if that it be granted that faith is the knowledge of remission) and <hi>the manifestation of remission also,</hi> must go before godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, or confession; (for <hi>satisfaction,</hi> we cannot well beare with the word) if it be objected that, that <hi>worldly tabernacle</hi> was a patterne of <hi>heavenly things,</hi> for so it was commanded <hi>Moses,</hi> that he should <hi>make it according to the fashion which he had seen,</hi> Act. 7.44. <hi>These things serve unto the example, and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished by God when he was about to make the tabernacle, for so saith he, that thou make all things, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the patterneshewed thee in the mount:</hi> Hebr. 8.5. Now if <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition</hi> went before <hi>remission</hi> in the <hi>earthly shadow,</hi> it must needs do so in the <hi>endlesse life;</hi> for they were one like another, one the pattern of another.</p>
            <p>I answer: That the <hi>contrition,</hi> &amp;c. is considerable in our high <hi>priest,</hi> or in the <hi>people</hi> (both priest, and people, and sacrifice in the Law, being types of our High Priest) now we say that in the Priest <hi>Christ Jesus, contrition</hi> went before <hi>remission; He</hi> was bruised, <hi>he</hi> was broken, yea <hi>he</hi> was slain before any remission could be pronounced to the miserable sons of <hi>Adam:</hi> for <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blood shedding there is no remission,</hi> Hebr. 9.22. So that in the <hi>Covenant</hi> of this endlesse life, the <hi>contrition, confession</hi> (I pray beare with the word) and <hi>satisfaction, blood shedding</hi> of <hi>Christ the Mediator,</hi> must needs go before <hi>remission:</hi> But that <hi>remission</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Mediator, yea faith (the Knowledge of remission) must needs go before the godly contrition or confession of the creature.</p>
            <p>I will spend a little time to open there two Propositions, and to clear the truth of them, that I may take away occasion from them who seek occasion, that they may have no more plea before the people to speak evill of the things they do not understand. For the first of them, that <hi>in the old Covenant, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, CONFESSION, and legall satisfaction, goes before remission;</hi> Although it need no proofe, yet for illustration, I shall speak a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66203:15"/>word, and referre them that desire farther satisfaction herein, unto the fourth, fifth, and sixth <hi>Chapters of Leviticus,</hi> wherein these things are set down at large. <hi>Levit.</hi> 5.5, 6. it is thus writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: <hi>And it shall be when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that he shall confesse that he hath sinned in that thing; And he shall bring his trespasse offering, unto the Lord for his sin which be bath sinned, a female of the flock, a lambe, or a kid of the goats for a sin offering, and the Priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him:</hi> ver. 10. This is the Law of the sin offering: confession, offering, atonement, and then forgivenesse; no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse to be looked for without these: And this also is the Prophets, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.21, 22. <hi>But if the wicked will turn from all his sins, that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawfull and right; he shall surely live, he shall not die: All his transgressions that he hath committed they shall not be mentioned unto him, in his righteousnesse that he hath done, he shall live.</hi> This is the Priphets, to declare repentance, as a means to obtain remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and neither remission, nor the knowledge of remission, to go before, but to follow contrition; But this is not the <hi>Gospel;</hi> which is established upon better promises: The Law and the Prophets teach us in that Convenat, to repent and bring our offering, as a means to obtain remission, to repent for remission: but the Gospel teacheth us to <hi>repent unto remission,</hi> Mark 1.4. it is indeed translated <hi>for</hi> remission: But <hi>unto,</hi> is written in the margent. This you shall see more at large in my book intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the <hi>Doctrine of John Baptist.</hi> The Gospel propounded unto us a sacrifice already offered, propitiation, atonement, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, already made, sin already finished, and then by the Ministery of reconciliation calleth uon us to repent unto remission. This is the Ministery of reconciliation (to wit) <hi>that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them:</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19. Christ is our Priest, our sacrifice, our atonement: He confesseth our sin, He offereth for our sin, He maketh a peace through his blood, and calleth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, to beleeve this peace and atonement made. But this will more plainly appear, when I shall prove unto you, that not onely remission, but even faith (the knowledge of remission) whose object is remission of sins in Jesus) must needs go before
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66203:16"/>godly contrition: <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. <hi>Whatsoever it not of faith, or from faith, is sin.</hi> All contrition that proceedeth not from faith, it is no better then sin; but godly repentance is not sin. Therefore it is not before faith, but from faith; we do not therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve remission of sins, because we repent: but we therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, because we beleeve remission of sins. Again the question is, whether or no, <hi>repentance</hi> is not a sacrifice of thanksgiving? if so, it presupposeth the knowledge of a benefit received. Thirdly, to speak in the language of holy Scripture, is not <hi>repentance</hi> a sacrifice well pleasing unto God? But <hi>without faith it is impossible to please God,</hi> Hebr. 11.6. I would not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, as though I thought the faith of Gods elect to remaine any time in the soul, void of repentance. But my meaning is to shew you the order of the work of the Spirit of God, who produceth not faith by repentance, but repentance by faith. Again, I do not deny but that there is a <hi>repentance</hi> of despaire, such as was that of <hi>Judas,</hi> going ordinarily before the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of remission. But this is not godly repentance, this is such repentance that many have had who have yet died in their sins. That I may be the better understood: I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this with the laying down of certain Propositions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>No repentance at all goeth before remission, or not imputing of sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Judas his repentance goeth commonly before the knowledge of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Godly repentance goeth not before, but followeth the knowledge of remission of sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this that hath been spoken, we have a discovery of the man of sin, setting up sin in the <hi>consciences of the people,</hi> and in the <hi>sight of God.</hi> When any shall declare unto you, that you cannot have any forgivenesse with God untill you repent: when the Proposition converted, will and hath been found true, <hi>viz.</hi> you cannot repent untill you have, and untill you perceive forgivenesse with God. Doth any man declare unto yet repentance as a means to obtain remission, and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse at the hands of the Father. These are the footsteps of the <hi>man of sin,</hi> of the son of perdition. And you have seen how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary this is to the grace of God manifested in the sufferings
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66203:16"/>of <hi>Jesus Christ:</hi> How contrary to the voice of the glorious <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel:</hi> which <hi>through this man</hi> (that is <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>) <hi>preacheth unto you forgivenesse of sins.</hi> Acts 13.38. Let us then learn to be wise, let us learn to discern this woolfe by his bark. Let the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the shew, the profession of holinesse be never so great; yet if they bring this doctrine, beleeve them not, it is but the <hi>man of sin:</hi> the limbs of <hi>Antichrist: wolves</hi> in sheeps cloathing; that seek not to <hi>feed you,</hi> but to <hi>feed upon you.</hi> Take heed, and beware.</p>
            <p>I have now opened a way, and declared unto you how most of the <hi>Romish</hi> doctrines, may be found guilty of this hainous crime; and how not <hi>Rome</hi> alone, but the Pulpits of <hi>England</hi> also may be discovered to be filled, with the man of sin, with the enemies of the grace of God. But I do not intend to stay upon any more particulars; but I will have an open eare, to heare indifferently, what <hi>Rome,</hi> and her children, and servants can say for themselves, against this accusation brought forth, and laid to their charge: for I think it unreasonable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne any before we heare them speak for themselves. I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose they will say, you do us injuries to say we are members of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> of the <hi>man of sin:</hi> for although we should confesse it an errour, as you have said, yet can we free our selves from being members of that <hi>man of sin:</hi> for it is said of him, in the very next words unto your text, <hi>Who opposeth and exalteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self above all that is called God, or that is worshipped: so that he as God, sitteth in the Temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.</hi> Now all know that we are farre from this; we worship the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and fear his name. Nay <hi>Rome</hi> telleth us that we have little reason to challenge them, for opposing all that is called God, or worshipped: when as in another charge, we lay against them, that they worship more gods then they ought. Now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this <hi>Apologie</hi> I answer. That we read of one that said, <hi>Sir I go,</hi> but <hi>went not:</hi> And he is not reputed to have done the will of his Father; whatsoever he said. So if we shall prove that such Doctrine as this exalteth it self above <hi>God,</hi> we shall be able to maintain our charge, and you will be left unable to acquit your selves. Some by <hi>God,</hi> in the place cited, do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> who in some sence is called God: <hi>I have
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66203:17"/>said ye are gods, &amp;c.</hi> that the man of sin doth exalt himselfe above Magistrates: And indeed this is true, and worthy our observation, how the <hi>man of sin</hi> doth closely contend, to bring Magistracy in subjection unto him, to make the Magistrate the executioner of his lusts, and impieties. But this is too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a limitation for the text: which saith, <hi>He exalteth himselfe above all that is called God:</hi> though the Magistrate is called God, yet he is not <hi>all</hi> that is called God, or that is worshiped. We shall desire to consider whether this man of sin be excusable in this kind; or not: and to see whether the <hi>man of sin</hi> doth not exalt himself above the God, and Father of our Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who is blessed for evermore. May not he that exalteth himself above the attributes of God, be truly said to exalt himself above God himself? for nothing is in God, but what is God. We shall then shew unto you that the <hi>man of sin</hi> doth exalt himself, above the glorious attributes of God. I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in foure. 1. <hi>Truth.</hi> 2. <hi>Wisdome.</hi> 3. <hi>Mercy.</hi> 4. <hi>Justice.</hi> And I shall declare how the man of sin, would appear to us to be more true than God. Secondly, wiser than God. Thirdly, more mercifull than God. Fourthly, more just than God.</p>
            <p>First, how <hi>Antichrist</hi> opposeth the truth of God, in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and make God a lyar. The truth of God is, that he hath set forth his Son <hi>Jesus Christ to be a propitiation for sin,</hi> that he preacheth remission in his name. But Antichrist will be bold to deny this, and to tell you openly, that these things are no better then fables; <hi>Christ hath not,</hi> nor will not take away your sins, untill you have repented of them. Before your tears of <hi>contrition,</hi> there is in God no <hi>remission</hi> for you; Christs sacrifice, and bloodshed, cannot avail you, untill you have washt away your sins by true repentance, and sorrow for them. Many things sof the like nature your eyes that read them, and your eares that heare them are witnesses of: And this the <hi>man of sin,</hi> will impose to be beleeved under paine of the greatest <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi> And he will be readie to say thus: <hi>Whosoever saith that Jesus Christ hath taken away any mans sin, before repentance, let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed.</hi> Thus will he be accounted more true than <hi>God,</hi> who hath said the contrary, in large and expressed terms, setting forth the death, and passion of our <hi>Lord Jesus,</hi> and the efficacy
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66203:17"/>thereof. <hi>God</hi> saith one thing, <hi>Antichrist</hi> the contrary: And he will be beleeved, otherwise all cannot be well. Now what is this but to oppose <hi>God,</hi> to exalt himself against the truth of <hi>God:</hi> I might instance in many severall particulars: wherein the <hi>man of sin,</hi> is neither ashamed, nor afraid, to contradict the very letter of the text, to impose a glosse, and interpretation, contrary to the manifest revelation of <hi>God</hi> in his Word: But it is not my desire to dwell upon particulars, but to shew you a way of discerning, &amp; discovery in some few, that you may be able for to judge of the rest. Now if to make <hi>God</hi> a lyar, oppose God, if <hi>God</hi> be not true he is no longer <hi>God.</hi> Then sure he that desireth to be beleeved, before <hi>God,</hi> to have his <hi>oracles</hi> to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted more true that <hi>God,</hi> to make void the truth of <hi>God,</hi> cannot be freed from exalting himself above God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, let us consider if <hi>this man of sin</hi> do not exalt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self above the wisdome of <hi>God,</hi> and would be accounted wiser than <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>wisdome of God</hi> hath been pleased, to set forth his Son <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> the Redeemer of the world, and hath given com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to his <hi>Apostles,</hi> to <hi>go preach the Gospel,</hi> or the glad tydings of the free grace of God, <hi>to all Nations,</hi> Matth. 28.19. yea as if this were not large enough, <hi>to every creature,</hi> Mark 16. And to set forth a plain, and easie way to them that are taught of God, so plain that <hi>the wayfaring men though fools shall not erre therein:</hi> Isa. 35.8. He hath given us a word, to be <hi>a light unto our feet, and a lantern nto our paths.</hi> And this word of grace the wisdome of God hath commanded to be preached plainly, openly, to every creature. <hi>Wisdome cryeth without</hi> (she seeks no concerns) <hi>she uttereth her voice in the streets, she erieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates, in the City she uttereth her words: yea she speaketh unto the simple ones, scorners, and fools. How long ye simple ones will ye love simplicity, and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge:</hi> Prov. 1.20, 21, 22. This is the wisdome of God: But <hi>Rome</hi> thinks she hath better policy than his, namely, to lock up the Scriptures in an unknowne tongue, and that out of love, and zeale, lest the simple ones should abuse it, and misunderstand it, and pervert it. And by this reason they should also lock it up from the learned, who
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:66203:18"/>do miserably pervert it. <hi>Gods wisdome</hi> saith, <hi>Search the Scriptures, try all things: Romes</hi> wisdome saith, Let them alone, it is not safe medling with them. Thus will <hi>Rome</hi> be wiser than God, and preferre the carnall policy of that <hi>man of sin,</hi> before the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the <hi>God of righteousnesse.</hi> Thus do his members seek to out-wit the God of heaven; who hath sent glad tydings to be preached to all, upon the house top: and the fulnesse, and the freenesse of the grace of God, to be manifested to all: But what saith the <hi>man of sin:</hi> That is not a safe course, though these things be true, yet (as <hi>Cardiner</hi> sometimes of <hi>Winchester</hi> said on his death-bed) if the people should know them, all will be married, for they will abuse it, they will turn the grace of God into wantonnesse. Therefore it is fit such things as these should be preacht but seldome, or onely in private: for this purpose we have stories told us, of a man in <hi>Cheapside,</hi> a <hi>mayd</hi> I know not where, and a <hi>woman</hi> in such a Lane, that did abuse the glorious tydings of the Gospel. I cannot go to search the truth of these things, which I beleeve not yet, unlesse we had better proofe, than the report in print: But suppose this be a truth, what then? It is not safe to preach the Gospel, and to set forth the true grace of God: what consequence is this? because there are many drunkards (and men of no mean rank) in the City, therefore wine must be banisht the City, let it come no more there: this would be in the Merchants, and Vintners eyes, a very absurd conseuence. And sure the consequence on the other part is seven times more absurd: we have no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory command, to bring wine into the City, but we have a command to preach the Gospel. A City might well subsist without wine, but the spirituall edification of the people of God, cannot subsist without the Gospel. <hi>O my God,</hi> I will preach thy Gospel, for thou hast said, go preach, and <hi>wo is unto me if I preach not the Gospel,</hi> I commit the successe unto thee. Thy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel is the <hi>power of God unto salvation;</hi> I will not be ashamed of it, it is a <hi>sweet savour unto thee,</hi> in them that are saved, and in them that perish: I perceive the foolishnesse of man, would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance it self above thy wisdome; and perswade us (if not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell us) to be silnet in thy truth. But let thy servants be filled with the fulnesse of God; that for <hi>Sions sake they may not hold their
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66203:18"/>peace, and for Jerusalems sake they may not rest, untill the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse thereof go forht as brightnesse, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.</hi> Isa. 62.1.</p>
            <p>Thirdlyh, the <hi>man of sin</hi> exalteth himself above the mercy of <hi>God.</hi> He will seem to be more mercifull than <hi>God;</hi> God gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man a Law, a righteous Law, and hath threatned the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression thereof with death; yea he that offendeth inone, is guilty of all, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.10. and <hi>cursed is every one that continueth not sin all things that are written in the book of this Law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3.13. Where it is plain, that the Lord denounceth a curse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>all persons,</hi> that continue not at <hi>all times,</hi> to performe this righteons Law <hi>in all things,</hi> and not any thing of this righteous Law shall be abated: for heaven and earth shall passe away, but not one jot or tittle of this Law shall perish: <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.18. Now what saith the <hi>man of sin</hi> to this; it cannot enter into his thoughts, but that God will be more mercifull than thus: for he will tell you that <hi>God accepteth the will for the deed,</hi> (which he doth indeed in them who are not under the Law but under grace) but unto them unto whom it is spoken that are under the Law, you see what is required; not onely to will, but also to do under paine of a curse. Again, where it is said, <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth not shall be damned,</hi> Mark 16. And where it is said, that <hi>Jesus Christ shall be revealed from heaven, with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:</hi> 2 Thes. 1.7, 8.</p>
            <p>Neither will this be credited by man, but he will tell you, that a <hi>desire to beleeve,</hi> is faith, and though a man do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, yet if he desire to beleeve, he shall be saved. Then must the text be changed, and we must read, he that <hi>destreth not to beleeve shall be damned.</hi> Again, the Justice of God declareth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, that there is <hi>no remission without blood shedding.</hi> And yet the man of sin will declare unto us that such or such a sin, which is not pardoned this day, may be pardoned to morrow, and a pardon may be procured and obtained by the shedding of some teares (but no man hath yet declared unto us how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) now it may be they will say, Christs blood was shed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or else teares could not have done it. Did the blood of Christ then make sin onely to become pardonable upon our
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:66203:19"/>teares? or did he procure pardon? for I am sure Christs blood doth not any new thing, what It did it did at once; and what it hath not done, it will never do; if so be that our sins were not pardoned before our teares, and pardoned after our tears: then will it follow, that Christs blood did onely make sin to become pardonable; that he did not procure remission, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse, or pardon for us. Thus you see the mercy of God opposed by the man of sin, and the man of sin exalting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and seeking to debase God. Now lest any thing that is called <hi>God</hi> should seem to escape, I must in the next place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto you the man of sin, opposing the <hi>Justice of God,</hi> He will be more Just than God.</p>
            <p>God hath given unto man, a most righteous, and holy Law, by which is the <hi>Knowledge of sin,</hi> Rom. 3.20. and 7.7. This Law hath he set so fast, that heaven and earth shall sooner passe away, then one jot or tittle from the Law till all be fulfilled: <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. But when it was impossible for any of the sons of <hi>Adam</hi> to fulfill the righteous Law, in regard that all of them are come short of the glory of God, and <hi>there is none that doth good, no not one.</hi> It pleased the God of love, and mercy, to send forth his Son <hi>Jesus,</hi> in the similitude of sinfull flesh, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne sin in the flesh, that <hi>the righteousnesse of the Law might be fulfilled in them, who live not after the flesh, but after the Spirit:</hi> Rom. 8.4. Now God setteth forth in his Word, the Law fulfilled, righteousnesse accomplished in his Son, <hi>Jesus.</hi> This he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth to be preached to the world. Now what saith the man of sin: That Christ hath suffered he dare not deny, but that his suffering hath given full satisfaction to the Justice of God, required in the Law, is that which he is bold to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict; and therefore they say, that Christ indeed hath taken away the <hi>guilt of sin,</hi> that he hath also taken away the <hi>eternall punishment</hi> due unto sin, but he hath not (say they) taken away the <hi>temporall punishment</hi> due to sin; This must either be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by us, by our tears, and humiliation, by our repentance, and contrition; otherwise if not prevented it must be indured. Hence do proceed, the doctrine of satisfactions in the Schools of <hi>Rome;</hi> hence proceeds, that clouded doctrine of repentance, in the <hi>Romish</hi> Doctors. There being indeed, no doctrine more available to the manifestation of the glory of God, more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:66203:19"/>to the souls of the people, more profitable to the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Church, than the <hi>Doctrine of true repentance</hi> tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught, and learned. There being also no Doctrine, more destructive to the truth of <hi>God,</hi> and the comfort of his people, than that cloudy and misty doctrine of repentance, taught by the factors of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereby they seek to overthrow at once, the whole building of the Temple of God. The summe of all is this. That whereas <hi>God</hi> saith the Justice of his Law is fulfilled, and <hi>he is well pleased in his Son,</hi> to declare that <hi>sin and iniquitie will he remember no more.</hi> This <hi>man of sin</hi> will be more Just than God, and say, that the Law is not fulfilled untill you repent, the Father will not be well pleased in his Son, until you have repented of your sins; Thus you see how the man of sin exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himself above the <hi>Justice,</hi> the <hi>Mercy,</hi> the <hi>Wisdome,</hi> and the <hi>Truth</hi> of God; and indeed it will be found true, that there is not any one attribute of God, but he hath sought to depresse, and to exalt and life up himself, and his own Doctrines; That by this means he might fulfill that which hath been foretold of him, <hi>He exalteth himself above all that is called God.</hi> As it was forespoken of him by the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> Dan. 11.36, 37, 38. <hi>And the King shall do according to his will, and he shall exalt himself, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie himself above every God, and shall speak marvellous things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, for that that is determined shall be done, neither shall be regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any God, for he shall magnifie himself above all. But in his estate he shall honour the God of swees: And a god whom his fathers knew not shall be honour, with gold, and silver, and with pretious stones, and pleasant things, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Having taken the first plea of Antichrist into consideration, and found it faulty; we will in the next place consider, one thing more which he alledgeth to prove that he is not that <hi>man of sin,</hi> that son of perdition. He will say; it is written, <hi>Who is a lyar but he that denyeth that Jesus is the Christ, He is Antichrist that denyeth the Father and the Son:</hi> 1 Joh. 2.22. Many deceivers are entred into the world, who confesse not that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is come in the <hi>flesh; This is a deceiver, and an Antichrist:</hi> 2 Joh. 7. From hence <hi>Rome</hi> and her children will argue, that they are not <hi>Antichrist,</hi> that they are not the <hi>man of sin,</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:66203:20"/>because they confesse that Jesus is the Christ, yea whosoever shall deny that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is come in the flesh, they hold him accursed. For the better clearing of this, and the opening of some places of Scripture, we must take it into consideration, what it is to deny or confesse Christ coming in the flesh. There are two things necessary to be beleeved, unto the constitution of the faith of <hi>Gods</hi> elect, and if either of these shall be found wanting, the faith will be found lame, and imperfect, yea no faith at all. The one is <hi>to beleeve rightly the office of the Mediator, and Redeemer.</hi> The other is, to beleeve rightly <hi>the true person:</hi> now he that beleeveth the person, and denieth the office, what doth he lesse than deny <hi>Christ</hi> coming in the flesh? Again, he that confesseth the office, but denieth the person, is as faulty as the other; now according unto this distinction, I find in the world a twofold Antichrist. The <hi>Hebrew Antichrist,</hi> and the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Antichrist;</hi> the <hi>Jewish Antichrist,</hi> and the <hi>Gentile Antichrist.</hi> The <hi>Jewish Antichrist</hi> beleeveth indeed the office of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor truly; yet I do beleeve, that in substance they are able to declare unto us, what is the true office of the Saviour of the world, wnen (as they beleeve) he shall be sent from the Father into the world. But beleeving his office, they deny his person, and will not have the crucified <hi>Jesus</hi> to be the Saviour of the world, but vainly look for another, for to come unto them: so that that you see that which is wanting unto the perfection of the <hi>Jewish</hi> faith, is no more but this, to be truly informed, and perswaded concerning the person of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of this giveth us light to interpret some places of Scripture, which (for want of this consideration) I find to be somewhat mistaken by others, of good judgement, and zeale. It is written, <hi>If ye beleeve not that I am be, ye shall die in your sins:</hi> Joh. 8.24. And the <hi>Eunuch</hi> demanding of <hi>Philip,</hi> what was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired unto <hi>Baptisme,</hi> and receiving an answer, that to beleeve with all the heart was, the thing required. He maketh his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession in these words; <hi>I beleeve that Jesus Christ is the Son of God:</hi> Act. 8.37. From which places, and some other like, some have gathered, that is sufficient for the Christian faith; to beleeve, <hi>that jesus Christ is the Son of God:</hi> and yet a man may have the true faith, though he beleeve not the remission of his sins, in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:66203:20"/>
               <hi>Jesus.</hi> These things do indeed requir<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> larger dispute than can be afforded unto them at this tim<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; onely I desire it may be considered, that the persons, with whom the dispute was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, <hi>Job.</hi> 8. were of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who rightly understood the office of the Messiah; and if they were faulty in any thing, it was in this, that they ascribed something more unto his office than was to be ascribed, but nothing lesse. Now there was nothing lacking unto their faith, save rightly to understand the person. The same is to be said concerning the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> who was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selyte of the <hi>Jews,</hi> for he came to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to worship: and therefore under the expectation of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> whose office he did understand: now it is granted that the man beleeving the office of <hi>Christ,</hi> it is sufficient for him to grant the person, and acknowledge him. And as the <hi>Jews</hi> beleeving the office, yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the person, were properly against <hi>Christ:</hi> So the <hi>Gentile Antichrist</hi> who confesseth <hi>Jesus of Nazareth,</hi> crucified at <hi>Golgatha,</hi> to be the Son of God, the <hi>Messiah</hi> of the Lord; may as properly (if not more properly) be called <hi>Antichrist;</hi> who confessing his person, is bold to deny his office. We do not lay unto <hi>Romes</hi> charge, that they deny the person of <hi>Christ.</hi> We have not any controversie with them concerning the person; but we charge them with deniall of his office, with denyall of the effect of Christs death, and passion. For when it shall be declared that the effect of Christs passion, requireth on ourparts a condition, and that Christs passion is not effectuall unto us, untill the condition on our parts be performed: we say that this is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the office of the Messiah, this is to deny the priesthood and sacrifice of <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> to take away sin, and to finish trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression; and unto us it doth appear, that the prerequiring of a condition, doth diminish the glory of the efficacy of Christs passion.</p>
            <p>Now to draw to a conclusion, you that have knowne the man of sin, will say that I have in part so discovered him in these lines, that they that are weak-sighted may be able to discerne him: I have done it for this end, that a spirit of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning may be ministred into you, that see but dimly and darkly; that whereas the man of sin cometh with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveablenesse
